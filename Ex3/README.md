# Exercise 3 - Kyverno UI Installation
In this exercise each student will install Kyverno UI on an Openshift cluster;

> Note! We are going to pull the Kyverno `helm chart` locally and edit the values file to fit our demands. This is also the procedure to install it in a disconnected environment.

> Also Note! For a full disconnected environment installation you should also pull the Kyverno `image` and import it to the disconnected network alongside the helm chrat itself.
